The goal of this project is to recreate the network congestion experiment performed by Hui-Ling. The title of the paper is Simulation of Computer Network Reliability with Congestion. The paper establishes a formula that determines the probability that all the nodes in a network are connected and the probability that one or more link in the network fails because of congestion. The main goal of using the two formulas is to recreate the tables presented in the results section of the paper and if possible apply them to a real work environment. The project will primarily be coded in python using the networkx library to handle visual and algorithmic elements.
